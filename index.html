          New paper online! We finished the LPV extension on data-driven predictive control for both the state-feedback and output-feedback case. Of course we a guideline how to use this for nonlinear systems and/or noisy data! <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07140" target="_blank">Check out the paper here.</a>

        <dt>24-09-2023</dt><dd>
          Today my 6 week-long visit at Florian Dörfler's group starts at ETH Zürich. I will give two talks there; a talk summarizing my research from the past year(s), and a tutorial on the LPV framework. I will also visit EPFL for a few days in the end of October. <br/>EDIT (06-11-2023): This was an amazing experience. I've been welcomed with open arms on both an academic and social level. IfA can be proud of being such a nice, vibrant group!

          I presented my paper "Direct data-driven LPV control of nonlinear systems: An experimental result" at the IFAC conference today. Next to that, it was also my birthday! What a nice way to celebrate your birthday <i>in Japan</i>! I also found out that for the CDC decision notifications, the two papers where I'm the main author have been accepted for presentation!
        </dd>
        <dt>04-04-2023</dt><dd>
          Now that the CDC deadline has passed, I'm glad to tell you that we have submitted <i>four</i> contributions!<br/>
          One joint L-CSS submission (which we hope is a landmark paper) that combines the universal shifted stability and performance ideas with data-driven LPV control. You can read that paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10648.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. <br/>
          Three regular submissions, which is mainly joint work with wonderful people. Two are on data-driven <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01859.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.17191.pdf" target="_blank">(STL) control</a> of LTI systems, while the other one is on the machine learning research line. The latter develops a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01828.pdf" target="_blank">stable and robust parametrization for learning LPV-ANN models</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>01-02-2023</dt><dd>
          Our Automatica paper <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/#pubconvexincrementaldissipativity" target="_blank">Automatica paper</a> "Convex Incremental Dissipativity Analysis of Nonlinear Systems" is now available online and can be read here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2023.110859" target="_blank">doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2023.110859<a/>.

          What is better to end the year with some nice announcements. <br/>
          First of all, our <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/#pubconvexincrementaldissipativity" target="_blank">Automatica paper</a> "Convex Incremental Dissipativity Analysis of Nonlinear Systems" has been accepted for publication! The extended version of the final submitted version can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14201" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>
          Secondly, we finished two papers on the data-driven LPV control research line; one journal paper (submitted to IEEE-TAC) titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17182" target="_blank">"Direct Data-Driven State-Feedback Control of LPV Systems"</a> and a conference paper (submitted to IFAC2023) titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17191" target="_blank">"Direct data-driven LPV control of nonlinear systems: An experimental result"</a>. Both papers discuss the direct data-driven synthesis of LPV state-feedback controllers, where the journal paper discusses all the theory, while the conference paper applies the theory in an experimental setting. In the end, we saw that one will only need 7 time-steps of measurement data for the design of an LPV state-feedback controller for an unbalanced disc system. See also a video of the experiments <a href="https://youtu.be/m9l61lR1Fw4" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/SyyUVy1sPsc" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>
          And finally, the <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/#publpvs2022" target="_blank">LPVS paper</a> has been published in the LPVS proceedings. You can find it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.11.287"  target="_blank">here</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>17-07-2022</dt><dd>
          Good news! The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04060" target="_blank">Deep-Learning-Based Identification of LPV Models for Nonlinear Systems</a> is accepted for presentation at, and publication in the proceedings of, the 61st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control in Cancun, Mexico. And the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09555" target="_blank">LPV Modeling of the Atmospheric Flight Dynamics of a Generic Parafoil Return Vehicle</a> that we submitted to the 5th IFAC Workshop on Linear Parameter Varying Systems is also accepted for presentation and publication!
        </dd>
        <dt>19-05-2022</dt><dd>
          We have two new pre-prints online: a paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04060" target="_blank">Deep-Learning-Based Identification of LPV Models for Nonlinear Systems</a> and a paper on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09555" target="_blank">LPV Modeling of the Atmospheric Flight Dynamics of a Generic Parafoil Return Vehicle</a>. Enjoy the read!</dd>
        <dt>23-02-2022</dt><dd>
          Our paper "Fundamental Lemma for Data-Driven Analysis of Linear Parameter-Varying Systems" has been published in the proceedings of the 60th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC). You can find it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC45484.2021.9683151"  target="_blank">here</a>.</dd>

      About me
    </h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        My name is Chris Verhoek, and I'm currently working as a PhD candidate in the Control Systems group (Dept. of Electrical Engineering) at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). I'm working on <i>data-based analysis and control of nonlinear systems with stability and performance guarantees</i>, closely together with my promotor <a href="https://rolandtoth.eu" target="_blank">Roland To&#769th</a> and co-promotor <a href="https://www.sofiehaesaert.com" target="_blank">Sofie Haesaert</a>. This can of course be approached from both a broad and narrow perspective, so let me specify a bit further! During my PhD trajectory, I'm focusing on two research lines: (i) data-driven analysis and control of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems using <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysconle.2004.09.003" target="_blank">Willems' Fundamental Lemma</a> (see <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/#pubcdc2021" target="_blank">my paper</a>), and (ii) learning-based model-augmentation using linear fractional represented artificial neural networks and a priori known first-principles models (see, e.g., <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/#pubblux2022" target="_blank">this abstract</a>). So, very exciting topics! You can find more details on my research <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/chris-verhoek" target="_blank">here,</a> or <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L4Nj_QkAAAAJ" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next to my love for exciting research, I'm also very much into hiking (see my <a href="https://personal.chrisverhoek.com/#iceland2021" target="_blank">blog</a> on my experiences during the Laugavegur trail), <a href="https://youtu.be/iHrag0xkAsE" target="_blank">jazz drumming</a> and the <i>art</i> of mathematics (see for example <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/733754/visually-stunning-math-concepts-which-are-easy-to-explain"  target="_blank">a beautiful thread</a>).

    <h2>Academic background</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        I obtained my BSc. degree in Mechatronics from the Avans University of Applied Sciences Breda in 2017, and my MSc degree in Systems and Control from the TU/e (cum laude) in 2020. During my MSc research, I worked on incremental dissipativity based analysis and control of nonlinear systems, and on a novel performance shaping framework for nonlinear systems. The research was carried out in the Control Systems group at the TU/e, under supervision of Roland To&#769th and Patrick Koelewijn. <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/incremental-dissipativity-analysis-of-nonlinear-systems-using-the" target="_blank">My MSc thesis</a> was selected as the best thesis of the year 2020 within the Electrical Engineering department. After my MSc graduation, I worked for 6 months as a University Researcher at the TU/e, prior to my PhD trajectory that started in February 2021.
